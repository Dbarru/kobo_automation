Some months ago, Amazon announced that we can no longer download our books locally; they can only be stored on Amazon's devices.

I'm not a Kindle user (fortunately); I use a Kobo, and all my eBook purchases are on the Kobo Store.

Kobo users can still download eBooks locally, but only one at a time. So, is this the end of the story? Not so fast. I have more than four hundred books, and to download a single book, I have to make three clicks and wait for the browser to complete each action.

Too much time to spend on this.

The solution I found is to automate the process with Python. So, if Kobo ever decides to stop book downloads, I’ll be ready.

(I’m also using this opportunity to parse data about my library in the Kobo Store—not much data, but enough to gain some intresting insights.)
